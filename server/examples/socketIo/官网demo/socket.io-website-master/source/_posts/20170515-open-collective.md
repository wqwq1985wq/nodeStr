Open Collective provides a transparent, sustainable, and secure way for people to support and sponsor <a href="https://opencollective.com/opensource">open source projects</a>. We are joining other great projects (you may have heard about <a href="https://opencollective.com/mochajs">MochaJS</a>, <a href="https://opencollective.com/gulpjs">GulpJS</a> or <a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack">webpack</a>, among <a href="https://opencollective.com/discover">lots</a> of other awesome projects) in the quest to ensure the project's sustainability.

## What is an Open Collective?

From their website:

*An Open Collective is a group of people with a shared mission that operates in full transparency.*

That allows both individuals and companies to sponsor our mission at Socket.IO (with potential tax benefits).

## What would Socket.IO do with my sponsorship?

That will enable the core contributors to spend more time assuring the maintenance of the project. That includes:

- triaging issues and pull requests

- answering questions on <a href="https://slackin-socketio.now.sh/">Slack</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/socket.io">Stackoverflow</a> (which have been somewhat neglected recently)

- updating the documentation (I think a lot has been done recently, but there is still room for improvement!)

Personally I would like to be able to devote a few days a month to the project (I mean a whole day of work, not a few hours taken here and there, usually late in the evening).

The goals in the near future:

- keep the 2.0 version as stable as possible
- provide a complete documentation
- add more examples, besides the classic chat

## How can I help?

To become a sponsor or backer, visit our <a href="https://opencollective.com/socketio">open collective page</a> and follow the instructions for becoming a part of our collective. Please also take the time to explore the other awesome collectives that people are supporting.

And finally, a big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/piamancini">Pia Mancini</a> and her partners for making this possible.
