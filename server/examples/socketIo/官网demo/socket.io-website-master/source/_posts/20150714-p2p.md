Today were very happy to introduce Socket.IO P2P, the easiest way to establish **a bidirectional events channel between two peers** with a server fallback to provide maximum reliability.

Lets look at the API and build a little chat application. Or check out <a href="https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-p2p">the repository</a> directly!

**Socket.IO <span style="color: #F04;">P2P</span>** provides an **easy and reliable** way to setup a <a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> connection between peers and communicate using the <a href="https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-protocol">socket.io-protocol</a>.

Socket.IO is used to transport <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webrtc/infrastructure/#what-is-signaling">signaling data</a> and as a <em>fallback</em> for clients where the WebRTC `PeerConnection` is not supported. Adding a simple piece of middleware to your socket.io setup enables this – no need to hand roll your own signaling exchange or set up, deploy and scale new servers.

## Usage

It only takes a few lines of code to set up the server and client.

Server:

```js
var io = require('socket.io')(server);
var p2p = require('socket.io-p2p-server').Server;
io.use(p2p);
```

Client:

```js
var P2P = require('socket.io-p2p');
var io = require('socket.io-client');
var socket = io();
var p2p = new P2P(socket);
p2p.on('peer-msg', function (data) {
  console.log('From a peer %s', data);
});
```

There are various options for the advanced user. Once signaling data has been exchanged an `upgrade` event is triggered and an optional callback is called.

```js
var opts = { numClients: 10 }; // connect up to 10 clients at a time
var p2p = new P2P(socket, opts, function(){
  console.log('We all speak WebRTC now');
});
```

## The Chat example

We will build a simple chat application, as our tradition dictates, but with P2P capabilities! In this application:

- Clients can send text messages to each other. Messages display in a timeline
- Clients connect to each other over socket.io and initially send messages via the server
- Clients can choose to **go private** – switching the transport to WebRTC
- All clients connected to the server can connect via WebRTC up to a maximum of 10 clients

All code from this example is included in the <a href="https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-p2p/tree/master/examples/chat">main repository</a>.

We first setup the client with `autoUpgrade` set to false so that clients can upgrade the connection themselves. Set `numClients` to `10` to allow up to 10 clients to connect with each other.

```js
var opts = {autoUpgrade: false, numClients: 10};
var p2psocket = new P2P(socket, opts)
```

Setup the event listeners:

```js
p2psocket.on('peer-msg', function(data) {
  // append message to list
});

p2psocket.on('go-private', function () {
  p2psocket.upgrade(); // upgrade to peerConnection
});
```

In this example, we want any clients connecting to the server to exchange signaling data with each other. We can use the server component as a simple middleware. Clients will connect on the root namespace.

If we wanted clients to exchange signalling data in rooms, rather than on a whole namespace, we could use the server module upon connection <a href="https://github.com/tomcartwrightuk/p2p-snake/blob/master/server.js">like this</a>.

```js
var server = require('http').createServer();
var p2pserver = require('socket.io-p2p-server').Server
var io = require('socket.io')(server);
server.listen(3030)
io.use(p2pserver);
```

We then setup listeners to pass messages between clients and to broadcast the `go-private` event.

```js
io.on('connection', function(socket) {
  socket.on('peer-msg', function(data) {
    console.log('Message from peer: %s', data);
    socket.broadcast.emit('peer-msg', data);
  })

  socket.on('go-private', function(data) {
    socket.broadcast.emit('go-private', data);
  });
});
```

Thats all you need: add a little markup we are off! Heres the demo application in action:
