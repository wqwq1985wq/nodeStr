We just published two fixes for `socket.io-client`:

- Building with `browserify` or `webpack` is now completely straightforward. No need to `exclude/ignore` or `noParse/externals` the `ws` module.

- Improved the JSONP transport when `socket.io-client` or `engine.io-client` are lazily evaluated or the `<script>` tag that included them gets removed.
