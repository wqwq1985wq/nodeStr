title: Socket.IO  â€”  Apache Cordova

Since Apache Cordova apps are written mostly in JS, it is actually really easy to use Socket.IO! Let&#8217;s walk through a small example.

First we prepare a simple server:

```js
var server = require('http').createServer();
var io = require('socket.io')(server);

io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) {
    console.log('socket connected');

    socket.on('disconnect', function () {
        console.log('socket disconnected');
    });

    socket.emit('text', 'wow. such event. very real time.');
});

server.listen(3000);
```

This server will simply listen to Socket.IO client connections, and will emit some text to them via a `text` event.

Now let&#8217;s get get down to the point. We want to start off by creating a new Cordova project to start modifying. Let&#8217;s start from scratch.

Running

```
npm install -g cordova
```

will install the actual Cordova cli tool we use to create projects, install/remove dependencies, and launch our emulator among other things.

```
cordova create socket.io-example socket.io.example socket.io-example
```

will make a new project template for us to start modifying. Feel free to poke around the newly created folder, called `socket.io-example` and take a look at some of the created files.

You should now be in the project folder. If you didn&#8217;t navigate there yet in command line, do it now with `cd socket.io-example`.

Since I&#8217;m developing this example on OS X, I&#8217;m going to build for iOS. You could do it similarly for Android. To add the build target, run the following:

```
cordova platform add ios
```

Next we want to build all the native components. We can do this by running

```
cordova build ios
```

Now let&#8217;s actually run the template application to see that everything is working. If you are on OS X, you can install the iOS emulator like so

```
brew install ios-sim
```

You should see the emulator open up with something like this when running `cordova emulate ios`:

Now that you see everything working with the actual setup, let&#8217;s start write some code. Open up `www/index.html` in your project directory. It should look something like this:

    <body>
        <div class="app">
            <h1>Apache Cordova</h1>
            <div id="deviceready" class="blink">
                <p class="event listening">Connecting to Device</p>
                <p class="event received">Device is Ready</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            app.initialize();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

To begin, we need to get the Socket.IO-client script. We can take it from the CDN like so:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.2.0/socket.io.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
```

Now to add actual logic, let&#8217;s write things below the `app.initialize` call. We might want to make sure that the device has loaded the application before running any of our code. We can do this like so:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  app.initialize();

  document.addEventListener('deviceready', function() {
    // code goes here
  });
</script>
```

This event will fire when the application has fully loaded. To add some actual logic, we just need to fill in that function. Let&#8217;s make something that receives the data emitted by our server on socket connection, and bring a notification box to show that text. Here&#8217;s what you could do:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  app.initialize();

  document.addEventListener('deviceready', function() {
    socket.on('connect', function() {
      socket.on('text', function(text) {
        alert(text);
       });
     });
  });
</script>
```

Let&#8217;s run the emulator again with `cordova emulate ios`, and here&#8217;s what you should see:

That&#8217;s it! I hope this will help to get you started! Have fun hacking!
